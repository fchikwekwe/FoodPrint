# Environment Tracker App

Have you ever wanted to improve your overall carbon output, but were not sure how to do it?

Food is a huge contributor to CO2 emissions and its also a very personal way to help prevent global warming.

This app is a food tracker that tells your your overall carbon output based on what you have eaten.

We are developing this app for a software product development course with a focus on user experience and user interfaces.

So far, we have made wireframes and tested them out on several individual. We have crafted user journeys to reflect the types of people that we are targeting for this app. This data informs our overall development strategy.

For information on what we are currently working on and what we plan to work on in the future, take a look at Notes.md.
