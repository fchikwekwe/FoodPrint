Have you ever wanted to improve your overall carbon output but were not sure how to do it?

Food is a huge contributor to CO2 emissions and its also a very personal way to help prevent global warming.

This app is a food tracker that tells you your overall carbon output based on what you have eaten.


## Are there other ways to learn more about FoodPrint?
Javier and I published a blog series (https://bit.ly/2GaQSa1) about our development process on this app.

If you would like more insight on how the app that we developed works, you can see a live user demo here https://vimeo.com/305850006.

## User Experience
This app is being developed with a focus on User Interface and User Experience design for a software product development course.

Along with starting development with the views in mind, we have made two wireframe iterations and tested them out on several individuals. Additionally, we have crafted user journeys to reflect the types of users that we are targeting for this app. This data informs our overall development strategy.

## Front-End Design
We used basic front-end tools for the look of this project including HTML, CSS, Handlebars and Bootstrap. As addressed above, we took a views-first approach within our MVC architecture, starting with what the user sees.

## Back-End Design
This project was developed using MongoDB, Node.js and Express.js in the back-end. We used resourceful and RESTful routing throughout and integrated authentication concepts.

## Testing
We used Mocha and Chai for testing. As with all projects, we aim for and achieved 100% test coverage. To run tests for this project, type the command 'mocha' or 'npm test' into your console from the root folder.

## Running
This project can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/. To check it out, type the command 'npm start' into your console from the root folder. If you would like to check out the current, live version of FoodPrint, go to https://know-your-foodprint.herokuapp.com/.
